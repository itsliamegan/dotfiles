* Liam's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I use Debian on a ThinkPad T450s and
X220. The main programs I use are Emacs and Firefox, so most of the
configuration here is for Emacs. I used to use vim and tmux, so those
configuration files can be found in this repository's history.

** Installation and Setup

From a fresh install of Debian, there are a few things you need to do
before using this repository. After boot, you must install sudo and
git as root via apt. Then, you can clone this repository into a
directory for your dotfiles - I use ~/dotfiles. After that, run
./install.sh and wait while all the necessary packages are installed
and files are symlinked. After that, you should be all set!
